//! This library implements the Bendersnatch curve, a twisted Edwards curve
//! whose base field is the scalar field of the curve BLS12-381. This allows
//! defining cryptographic primitives that use elliptic curves over the scalar
//! field of the latter curve. This curve was generated by Simon Masson from
//! Anoma, and Antonio Sanso from Ethereum Foundation, and is also known as [bandersnatch](https://ethresear.ch/t/introducing-bandersnatch-a-fast-elliptic-curve-built-over-the-bls12-381-scalar-field/9957).
//!
//! See [here](https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/blob/main/README.md) for the specification of the curve.
//! There was also a Python implementation [here](https://github.com/asanso/Bandersnatch/).
